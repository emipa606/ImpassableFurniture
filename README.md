You want to make buildings impassable ? Well then you came to the right place 

This mod searches the entire database of furniture and gives you the option to make them impassable.
Should work with pretty much every mod.

Default option is that no furniture is impassable.
Check out the mod settings to change that.

Making beds and chairs impassable will result in them not beeing able to sleep and eat.
This will make them impassable for you as well as your enemies.
